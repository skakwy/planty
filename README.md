Plant Watering Software with C++ Server and React Native App

This project is a comprehensive plant watering software solution that includes a C++ server and a mobile app developed with React Native. The software allows users to efficiently manage their plant watering schedules and monitor the health of their plants.

Key Features:
- C++ Server: The backend server is implemented in C++, providing a robust and efficient foundation for handling plant watering data, scheduling, and communication with the app.
- React Native App: The mobile app, built with React Native, offers a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the plant watering system. It provides features such as plant management, watering reminders, and real-time plant health monitoring.
- Plant Management: Users can add, edit, and remove plants from their collection, providing essential information such as plant species, watering frequency, and preferred conditions.
- Watering Reminders: The app sends timely reminders to users, ensuring they never forget to water their plants. Customizable watering schedules can be set based on individual plant needs.
- Automatic Watering: When connected to a self-made water pump using an ESP8266 and custom firmware, the plants are automatically watered, and users can conveniently monitor the water level through their dashboard.
- Plant Health Monitoring: The software enables real-time monitoring of plant health, including vital parameters such as soil moisture (planned), temperature (planned), and light levels (planned). Alerts and notifications are provided in case of unfavorable conditions or potential plant issues.
- Data Synchronization: The C++ server and React Native app synchronize data seamlessly, ensuring that plant information, watering schedules, and health data are always up to date across multiple devices.
The combination of the C++ server and React Native app offers a powerful and user-friendly solution for plant enthusiasts to effectively manage their plant care routines. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced gardener, this software provides the tools and insights needed to keep your plants healthy and thriving.
